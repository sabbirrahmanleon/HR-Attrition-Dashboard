# HR-Attrition-Dashboard

Here's an HR Attrition Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel. This dashboard provides key insights into employee attrition trends, helping HR teams make data-driven decisions.


How I Built This Project:
ðŸ”¹ Collected and cleaned Raw data using Excel functions
ðŸ”¹ Used Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts to analyze trends
ðŸ”¹ Created interactive slicers & filters for dynamic insights
ðŸ”¹ Designed a clean, user-friendly dashboard for better visualization and easier comprehension

Key Insights from the Dashboard:
ðŸ“Œ Overall attrition rate is 16.12%, with 237 employees leaving out of 1,470
ðŸ“Œ R&D department has the highest attrition (133 employees), followed by Sales (92 employees)
ðŸ“Œ Employees aged 25-34 have the highest attrition rate (112), indicating possible retention challenges for younger talent
ðŸ“Œ Bachelorâ€™s degree holders (99 attritions) are leaving at a higher rate than other education levels
ðŸ“Œ Single employees (120 attritions) have a significantly higher attrition rate than married or divorced employees

This project helped me sharpen my data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation skills tremendously.
